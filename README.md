## Style note
In my javascript code here, I will use 'const foo = () => {}'
style for 'private' functions and for public ones I will use the  
'function foo() {}' style...   ...maybe 'public/private' is not what I am doing.  Perhaps 'independent/dependent' would be a better way to put it.     	

## How to run
This has zero backend logic. It does need a web server. Depending on which python version I happen to be using I use either:   
python -m http.server 3030    
OR    
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3030       
In the browser you can see this at:     
http://localhost:3030/diagram.html

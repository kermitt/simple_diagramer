## Style note
In my javascript code here, I will use 'const foo = () => {}' func  
declaration style for 'private' functions and for public ones I will use the  
'function foo() {}' style...   ...maybe 'public/private' is not what I am doing. 
Perhaps 'independent/dependent' would be a better concept dyad.
